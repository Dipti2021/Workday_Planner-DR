 ## Introduction 
It is a  calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.My aim was to create a work day planner for each hour of a day from 9am to 6 pm. ican storemy schedule using local storage and it is built using **Javascript** programming language along with the help of certain libraries like ***Bootstrap,moment.js and jQuery*** to name a few.

 ## Working of the Application
   A schedule between the time from __9 am to 6 pm__ has been created and the current day day and time are displayed on the top of the page.
   The planner is created for __an hour__ each.
   The user is required to choose a time slot to __enter a task__ which are then __stored__ in the __local storage__.
   Even on __refreshing__ the page, the task is __still accessible__ to the user.
   The workday id divided into three classes, namely, past, present and future.
   The __three colors__, which are grey,red and green have been __related__ with the respective classes.
    The Planner gets __updated__ to a __new day and a new time__ if you click on in on any __other__ day.
