 ## Working of the Application
  The below shows video shows how the code will respond to __three__ different situations.
    __First__ being the onein which we enter the password length with is not between 8 and 128.
    __Second__ shows the generations of the password when all the conditions are termed OK.
    In the __third__ situation, a password is generated depending upon the conditions which have been accepted by the user.

 ## Assignment Details
  The random password generator has been created using HTML, CSS and Javascript to code.The aaplication has been created keeping in mind the following conditions:
   * This application can be used to generate a random password between 8 and 128 characters.
   * It is upto the discretion of the user to choose how they want to construct their password. 
   * The password can be created using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numeric characters, and special characters.
   * If the number entered by the user does not fall in the given range, then no password will be generated.
   * Depending upon the prompts chosen by the user, the password will be generated accordingly.

  *Keeping all these conditions in mind, I have created the Javascript code using the if, else if and else conditions to generate the required password.On generating a random string of characters, they were joined and presented as a password using functions like*  `.concat()`, `math.floor()` and `math.random()`
